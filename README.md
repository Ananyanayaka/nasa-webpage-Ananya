# nasa-webpage-Ananya

## Overview
**Main Web**(nasa-webpage-Ananya) is a landing page that provides users with easy access to two exciting space exploration apps built using NASA's Open APIs.

- **Web1 (APOD App)**: Displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from NASA, showcasing beautiful images and detailed descriptions.
- **Web2 (NASA Image  Library)**: Allows users to search and view images from NASA’s extensive library.

This **Main Web** project serves as a simple React frontend that links to **Web1** and **Web2**. It is deployed on **Vercel** and provides a seamless navigation experience between both applications.
